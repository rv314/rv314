## 🧠 Projects

My work bridges advanced AI techniques with practical system architecture.

### **[GenAI Terminal Assistant]**

> The GPT Terminal Assistant is a context-aware, modular Generative AI solution designed to enhance engineering productivity. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, integrating OpenAI LLMs and ChromaDB vector stores to provide semantic memory for conversational history. Architected using registry patterns, the application allows for plug-and-play swapping of LLM, embedding, and vector store backends, making it production-ready and highly adaptable for various use cases (e.g., Qdrant, Pinecone). The architecture prioritizes Configuration-as-Code and includes comprehensive evaluation-ready logging (JSONL) and a full CI/CD pipeline, demonstrating a strong foundation in MLOps principles applied to AI tooling.

### **[Assist Kit]**

> AssistKit is a modular, extensible Generative AI framework engineered to power powerful, context-aware assistants across various business needs (e.g., Chat, RAG, custom Agents). Built on an abstracted, pluggable architecture (LLMs, Embedders, Vector DBs), the framework separates business logic from AI model backend implementation. It features a robust Orchestrator pattern to manage complex interaction flows, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for document Q&A and structured session management. This foundation is designed for enterprise-level scaling and easy integration into different interfaces (FastAPI backend, planned Next.js frontend).
